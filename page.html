    So I am from Ukraine, 18 years old and now studying in Inholland. My previous education was in scientific lyceum, and then i got level A2 of Dutch language in SKC Het Gooi in Naarden. Studied the whole summer to pass the IELTS test and finally got it. I have two pugs, my family also in the Netherlands enjoying this perfect country.
